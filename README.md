There are some C++ &amp; OpenCV programs I made for my "Elaborazione delle Immagini" (trad. Image Analysis) course at my University.

The programs should be compiled with cmake and make and were made using OpenCV version 4.0.1 .

I apologize that variables' names, functions' names, windows' names and some commentsin most of the programs are in Italian.
Maybe one day I'll change all of the to English.
