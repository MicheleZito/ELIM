These are some C++ &amp; OpenCV programs/algorithms I made for my "Elaborazione delle Immagini" (trad. Image Analysis) course at my University.

The programs should be compiled with cmake and make and were made using OpenCV version 4.0.1 .

I apologize that variables' names, functions' names, windows' names and some commentsin most of the programs are in Italian. Some comment blocks also explain important parts of the code and how algorithms work.

Maybe one day I'll change all of them to English, who knows?.
