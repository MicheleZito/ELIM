# Harris Corner Detector

These are two implementations of the Harris Corner Detector algorithm. 
As like for the CannyEdgeDetector, the "harris.cpp" file has also the Gauss and Sobel filters implemented by me; instead, 
the "harris_v2.cpp" file is the Harris algorithm implemented using the Gauss and Sobel filters of OpenCV itself.
